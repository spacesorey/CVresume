                    <p>Dear Dr. Seely,</p>

                    <p>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Master of Arts in English program at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. As a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Lindenwood University, I am excited about the opportunity to further my studies and contribute to the vibrant academic community at UMSL.</p>

                    <p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have developed a deep passion for literary analysis, critical theory, and creative writing. Your program's emphasis on these areas, along with the flexibility to pursue individual interests, aligns perfectly with my academic and professional goals. I am particularly drawn to the program's focus on literature, critical theory, and rhetoric and composition, as these areas will provide a strong foundation for my aspirations in copyediting and content creation.</p>

                    <p>My academic background has honed my critical thinking skills through in-depth textual analysis and research projects. I have also cultivated emotional awareness and empathy through character studies and narrative analysis - skills that I believe are crucial in understanding and interpreting literature. </p>

                    <p>In addition to my academic experiences, my professional background in customer service has strengthened my communication skills and ability to connect with diverse audiences. These experiences have taught me the importance of clarity, precision, and audience awareness in communication â€“ skills that I believe will be valuable in graduate-level research and writing.</p>

                    <p>I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work closely with UMSL's distinguished faculty and to engage in the program's emphasis on critical approaches to literature and culture. The program's commitment to preparing students for diverse career paths, including teaching and publishing, aligns well with my professional goals in copyediting and content creation.</p>

                    <p>Furthermore, I am impressed by the program's supportive environment and the opportunities for professional development through teaching assistantships and involvement in academic conferences. I am eager to contribute to and learn from this collaborative academic community.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of joining the MA in English program at UMSL and contributing to its rich academic tradition. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and goals align with the program's objectives.</p>

                    <p>Sincerely,</p>
                    <p>Oz Steffe</p>
